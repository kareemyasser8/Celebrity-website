                    Avril Lavigne Reveals She's Still 'Friends' with Exes Chad Kroeger & Deryck Whibley!
                </div>
                <div class="current-paragraph">
                    Avril Lavigne and boyfriend Phillip Sarofim are all smiles as they make their way out of the SiriusXM studios on Tuesday morning (February 19) in New York City.
                    The 34-year-old singer had an interview with The Morning Mash Up to promote her new album Head Above Water, which is available in stores now.
                    While on the show, Avril also opened up about being close with her ex-husband Chad Kroeger and her ex-boyfriend, Sum 41 frontman Deryck Whibley. “I’ve had really great relationships and good connections and bonds. Some might say because we’re Canadian but before him, Deryck Whibley from Sum 41, we keep in touch and like our moms hang out,” Avril revealed. “They were like my long terms. Deryck and I were together for 6 and a half years and that’s a long time. It’s a whole chunk of your life. Chad and I are still friends and we work together. I’m glad it’s like that, it makes me happy.”She continued, “Thank you for waiting so patiently as I fought through and still continue to fight, the battle of my lifetime. The first song I am choosing to release is called “Head Above Water.”

                    Avril Lavigne Teases New Songs 'Dumb Blonde,' 'It Was In Me' & 'Tell Me It's Over'
                </div>
                <div class="current-paragraph">
                     Avril Lavigne is teasing more music from her upcoming album, Head Above Water! The 34-year-old singer-songwriter released more teasers of tracks featured on the upcoming album on Wednesday (February 6), including one called “Dumb Blonde,” written with Bonnie McKee and Mitch Allan.
                    “I had this f–king loser in my life who was threatened by my strength, confidence and independence as a woman. I was belittled and made to feel bad for who I was: A leader, someone with a vision and opinions, someone who has strength, desire, passion and goals. Never let anyone put you down for being who you are. Stand up. Fight. Be you. Love. Be genuine. Kind.
                    Find yourself and own it. F–k stereotypes. If you’re a strong person and your partner can’t handle you, go find someone who has enough self-confidence and can support you and lift you up and inspire you in your life. As an equal. A friend. Not someone who needs to take you down to make themselves feel better because of their low self-esteem. Yes, women should build each other up, but so should men and women.” She also teased more new songs from the album, including “It Was In Me” and “Tell Me It’s Over.”

                    Avril Lavigne Addresses Conspiracy Theory That She Died Back in 2003
                </div>
                <div class="current-paragraph">
                    Avril Lavigne wants everyone to know that she is the real Avril Lavigne. During a recent interview with Australia’s KISS 1065, the 34-year-old singer was asked to comment on the crazy conspiracy theory that she died 15 years ago and has been replaced by clones.
                    “Did you laugh at the rumors that went around where you no longer exist and there’s a clone of you?,” the interviewer asked.
                    Avril replied: “Yeah, some people think that I’m not the real me, which is so weird! Like, why would they even think that?” If you didn’t know, back in 2017 a Twitter user claimed to find “evidence” that Avril had committed suicide back in 2003 after the death of her grandfather.
                    Since this was during the height of her “Sk8er Boi” days, her record company supposedly hired a body double named Melissa Vandella to replace her. The theory has been going on for years as people pulled together evidence of Avril‘s changes in handwriting, style evolution, and appearance to prove Melissa‘s existence

                    Avril Lavigne Defends Nickelback After Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Comment
                </div>
                <div class="current-paragraph">
                    Avril Lavigne did not agree with Mark Zuckerberg‘s recent Nickelback diss.
                    The 32-year-old singer took to Twitter to voice her opinion about the comment, which was made by the Facebook CEO in his video about the social media site’s new AI program Jarvis. In the video, Mark asks the AI to “play us some good Nickelback songs.” “I’m sorry Mark, I’m afraid I can’t do that,” the AI replies (in Morgan Freeman‘s voice). “There are no good Nickelback songs.” “Many people use your products – some people love them and some people don’t,” Avril wrote on Thursday (December 22). “Either way, you’re allowed your musical opinion however, your jab at Nickelback is in poor taste.” In case you didn’t know, Nickelback‘s frontman is Avril‘s ex-husband Chad Kroeger. Watch the full Jarvis video below.
